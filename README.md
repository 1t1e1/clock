# Clock 

## Purpose

I'm trying to learn how animations are made in JS.

## What I learned 
- The problem in *MY-clock-from-JS30.html* file comes from [JavaScript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables). The code changes only the css settings. 

- I just did *clock_with_canvas.html* using the [MDN Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) documentation.
